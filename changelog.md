## 0.0.3
*TW, 12/04/21*
- Allow the computation of merger times with ``get_merger_times``
    - After computing, times are used automatically
    in subsequent SNR calculations to avoid doubling up the computation
- Add ``evolve_sources`` function that evolves sources through time, updates merger times and if necessary marks them as merged
    - Merged sources are ignored in other computations (e.g. strain and SNR)
