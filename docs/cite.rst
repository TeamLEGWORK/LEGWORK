Citing LEGWORK
==============

If you use LEGWORK in a scientific publication we ask that you please cite it. LEGWORK was jointly published in ApJS and JOSS
and **we ask that you please cite both papers**.

Below we include two ready-made BibTeX entries, one for each paper. We recommend that you cite the ApJS paper
when you mention LEGWORK in the main text and cite the JOSS paper in the Software section at the end of your paper.
