Welcome to gw-calcs's documentation!
====================================
**LEGWORK** (**L**\ ISA **Ev**\ olution and **G**\ ravitational **W**\ ave **OR**\ bit **K**\ it) is designed to keep all those pesky factors of a few that enter into the calculation of signal to noise ratios for GWs emitted from inspiraling binary systems that are potentially observable by LISA. 

LEGWORK also contains a plotting module and treats any and all kinds of inspiralling binaries. 
Circular and stationary? No problem!
Eccentric and chirping? We've got you covered!

Let us do the LEGWORK and keep the LISA literature free from spurious factors of 2!
