**LEGWORK** (**L**\ ISA **E**\ volution and **G**\ ravitational **W**\ ave **OR**\ bit **K**\ it) is a python package designed to calculate signal-to-noise ratios for GWs emitted from inspiraling binary systems that are potentially observable by LISA. 

LEGWORK also contains a plotting module so you can show off those detectable GW sources of yours and treats any and all kinds of stellar-origin inspiralling binaries. 
Circular and stationary? No problem!
Eccentric and chirping? We've got you covered!

Want to determine if *your* favorite source is detectable by LISA? Let LEGWORK do the legwork and keep the LISA literature free from spurious factors of 2!
