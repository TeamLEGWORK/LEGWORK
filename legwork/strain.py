    """Computes the modulation of the strain due to the orbit averaged response of the detector to the
    position, polarisation, and inclination of the source using Cornish+03 Eq.42 and Babak+21.

    Note that since the majority of the calculations in LEGWORK are carried out for the full position,
    polarisation, and inclination averages, we include a pre-factor of 5/4 on the amplitude modulation
    to undo the factor of 4/5 which arises from the averaging of :meth:`legwork.utils.F_plus_squared` and
    :meth:`legwork.utils.F_cross_squared`.

    Additionally, note that this function does not include the factor of 1/2 from the Cornish+03 paper in
    order to remain in the frequency domain. More recent papers (e.g. Babak+21) define the strain as
    h(f)~A(f)*e^(2*i*psi(f)) and so the inner product is 1 instead of 1/2 as in Cornish+03.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : `SkyCoord/array`, optional
        Sky position of source. Must be specified using Astropy's :class:`astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` class.

    polarisation : `float/array`, optional
        GW polarisation angle of the source. Must have astropy angular units.

    inclination : `float/array`, optional
        Inclination of the source. Must have astropy angular units.

    Returns
    -------
    modulation : `float/array`
        modulation to apply to strain from detector response

    Computes the dimensionless power of a general binary radiating gravitational waves in the quadrupole

    to the number of harmonics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m_c : `float/array`
        Chirp mass of each binary. Shape should be (x,).

    f_orb : `float/array`
        Orbital frequency of each binary at each timestep. Shape should be (x, y),
        or (x,) if only one timestep.

    ecc : `float/array`
        Eccentricity of each binary at each timestep. Shape should be (x, y), or (x,) if only one timestep.

    n : `int/array`
        Harmonic(s) at which to calculate the strain. Either a single int or shape should be (z,)

    dist : `float/array`

    position : `SkyCoord/array`, optional
        Sky position of source. Must be specified using Astropy's :class:`astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` class.

    polarisation : `float/array`, optional
        GW polarisation angle of the source. Must have astropy angular units.

    inclination : `float/array`, optional
        Inclination of the source. Must have astropy angular units.

    interpolated_g : `function`
        A function returned by :class:`scipy.interpolate.interp2d` that computes g(n,e) from Peters (1964).
        The code assumes that the function returns the output sorted as with the interp2d returned functions
